# Frontend Mentor Tip Calculator

I built this as a one day project so I could use it as a coding challenge in an interview process. It was a fun build.

## Tech Used

- SvelteJS - I've been on a svelte kick lately I though this would be a fun project to try in the framework.
- CSS - I just used Svelte's built in scoped css styles for this.

You only need two commands to run locally.
